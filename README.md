# Smart Home Environmental Monitor – README
🌟 Overview
This project is a Smart Home Environmental Monitoring and Control System using an Arduino UNO, designed to:

Continuously monitor temperature, humidity, and air quality.

Display this data on an I2C LCD.

Provide remote control of home appliances or systems via serial commands (can be integrated with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or mobile app).

Perfect for smart home applications such as:

Air quality management

Automated HVAC control

Remote appliance management
